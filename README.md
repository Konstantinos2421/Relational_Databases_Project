# Relational_Databases_Project
A project about MySQL database management.
  
In this project a management system for a travel agency is implemented and consists of two main parts:
- MySQL Database
- GUI App

The "database" folder contains files with code for creating and managing the database:
- travel_agency.sql: It contains SQL code for creating the database.
- procedures.sql: It contains SQL code for the procedures of the database.
- triggers.sql: It contains SQL code for the triggers of the database.
- inserts.sql: It contains some initial inserts for the database so that we can test the final app.
- ER Diagram.png: An image of the ER diagram of the database.

The "travel_agency_app" folder contains Java code that implements the app from which we manage the travel agency. The app was made with the Netbeans IDE which supports GUI designer.
